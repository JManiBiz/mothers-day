   <p>Roman emperor and Stoic philosopher, Marcus Aurelius wrote in his book 'Meditations' about the things he learned from his mother;
     <blockquote> "From my mother, piety and beneficence, and abstinence, not only from evil deeds, but even from evil thoughts; and further, simplicity in my way of living, far removed from the habits of the rich."
   </blockquote>
   For Mother's Day, I haved decided to make my own list. 20 years and 6 months ago, I officially made you a mother. So, I am going to list the 20 things that I learned/inherited from my mother.
   </p>
    </div>
  <div id="list">
  <ol>
    <li>I learned humilty. To be humble in all my successes and give thanks to God for it.</li>
    <li>I learned to give my aboslute best in everything. Do it well or don't do it at all.</li>
    <li>I learned to have faith, not only in God but to have faith in the process, that things will be alright.</li>
    <li>My strength came from her. Seeing her struggle with life but she kept on going, no matter what.</li>
    <li>I learned to be persistant in everything. Never leave something unfinished, no matter how long it takes.</li>
    <li>I inherited her constant quest for knowledge.</li>
    <li>I gained her passion for music and her appreciation for the arts.</li>
    <li>My creativity, my ability to create something from nothing. That's all thanks to her.</li>
    <li>Her intelligence was passed down to me. I don't only mean smarts, but I have her logical, analytical way of thinking as well.</li>
    <li>I gained her looks and I mean it in the literal sense. Persons call me her carbon-copy.</li>
    <li>I got her fears as well. It may not be a positive trait, but we shall quiver in fear together.</li>
    <li>I got her love for life. Her ability to enjoy most days and just be grateful for waking up.</li>
    <li>I got her love for God. I may not have the same fervour as her but it is there.</li>
    <li>I gained her literary skill and learned to love reading.</li>
    <li>I gained her dislike for pictures. Another negative gain but it just makes any pictures that we take together extra special.</li>
    <li>I gained for love of family and to cherish them with my heart and soul.</li>
    <li>I learned the importance of self-improvement. To never be stagnant and complacent in my current position but to want the best for myself, always.</li>
    <li>While on the quest for knowledge, I gained her course junkie habit. Jumping from course to course, learning as much as I can.</li>
    <li>Like a true mother, she taught me her caring ways. To always want to care for others in any way possible.</li>
    <p>But the greatest thing that I could ever learn from my mother,</p>
    <li>True love from the day I was born.</li>
    </ul>
